/** Ownership 
 * Rust doesn't have a garbage collector
 * Memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks.
 * If any of the rules are violated, the program won't compile.
 * 
 * Ownership rules:
 *  Each value in RUst has an owner
 *  There can only be one owner at a time
 *  When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped
